Dragon Curve SVG Creator

Directly inspired by and using code from Gainsboroow 
(Github : https://github.com/Gainsboroow; Github Repository : https://github.com/Gainsboroow/Dragon-Curve)

This is an extension of Gainsboroow's Dragon Curve Visualiser that generates a set of dragon curve svg's. I developed this for an art project involving a puzzle made of laser cut
dragon curves generated from this code.
